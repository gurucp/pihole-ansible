## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gurucp/pihole-ansible.git
cd pihole-ansible
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Update the inventory file
Edit the inventory file to include your Pi-hole server's IP address and SSH user.

Example:
```bash
[pihole]
192.168.0.2 ansible_user=pi
```

## Very Important:!!!!
```bash
Edit vars.yml file 
cleanup_adlists: true # If it is set to true it will remove all existing on your pihole and add new entries 
cleanup_adlists: false # If it is set to false, it will not remove existing once rather it will add whatever in the addlists.yml
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Edit adlists.yml
Add or remove blocklists as needed inside adlists.yml.

Example snippet:
```bash
adlists:
  - "https://adaway.org/hosts.txt"
  - "https://v.firebog.net/hosts/AdguardDNS.txt"
  # Add more as needed
```
Update the vars.yml file 

pihole_web_password: "testpass123" # Set password here 
pihole_blocklists_cleanup: true    # Set to true if you are reconfiguring the pihole and would like to       remove existing addlist 


4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the playbook
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory manage_pihole_adlists.yml
```
